# 🏎️ F1 Race Position Predictor

![website](https://f1predictor.onrender.com/)

This project is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts Formula 1 race outcomes based on driver and team data. Built with Django for the backend and deployed with an interactive interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal was to:
- Create a user-friendly interface to input race parameters
- Use historical F1 data to train a predictive model
- Display race position predictions dynamically

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data handling
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Django** for web backend
- **HTML/CSS** (AI-generated) for frontend UI
- **SQLite** or CSV-based data storage

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Input driver and constructor details
- Predict finishing positions using a trained ML model
- Lightweight, interactive web interface
- Easy to update with new race data

## 💡 Model Insights

- Used classification/regression techniques to estimate race rankings
- Feature engineered various race metrics
- Evaluated model performance with standard metrics (accuracy, MAE, etc.)

## ✅ Outcome

Created an end-to-end working web application capable of predicting F1 driver performance based on inputs, demonstrating the integration of ML models into production web environments.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

- Inspired by real F1 data trends
- Built as a personal project to explore MLOps and deployment
